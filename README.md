# Data-Scraping-Web-Portal is: "Transform web data into actionable insights."
This is my first Project.
A full-stack web application that automatically collects data from GIAN website via a robust web scraper and presents it through an interactive, visual dashboard.
## Web Scraper
- **Automated Data Collection**: Scheduled scraping tasks to gather data from **GIAN website**.
- **Resilient Design**: Built-in error handling, retry mechanisms, and respect for 'robots.txt' rules.
- **Data Processing**: Cleans, transforms, and structures raw HTML into structured JSON/CSV data.
- **Multiple Targets**: Capable of scraping comprehensive course data, including **titles, institute names, start/end dates, and brochure links**.
  
## Web Portal
**Interactive Dashboard**: A clean, responsive interface to view, search, and filter all collected data.
RESTful API: A dedicated API endpoint to access the scraped data programmatically.
